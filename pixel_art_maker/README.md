# Pixel Art Maker Project
![my screenshot](pixel-art.png "Pixel Art")
## About
A single-page web app that allows users to create artistic designs on a customizable canvas.
The main goal of this project is to implement the `makeGrid()` function, that dynamically creates a grid the user can interact with.
## What I learned
* Defining variables with `const` and `let`.
* Interacting with the DOM via jQuery.
* Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners.
* Writing nested loops and using loop variables.

## Capabilities
* Dynamically set the size of the width and height grid.
* Choose a color.
* Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
* Erase the color.
