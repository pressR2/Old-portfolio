# Portfolio website
## About
A simple functional responsive webpage transform from a design mock-up. Complete with images, text descriptions, and links to each of the portfolio projects.
## What I learned
The main goal of this project is to learn how HTML is used to define the content of a web page. How to position DOM elements using the CSS flex-box patterns and make them good looking.
